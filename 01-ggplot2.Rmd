## Introduction

In this chapter, we'll explore the package `ggplot2`. Package ggplot2 is one of the most popular packages of R, and a de facto standard for creating publishable visualizations.

Whole books have been written about ggplot2 (e.g. [ggplot2 - Elegant Statistics for Data Aanalysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/)); these will not be repeated here. Instead, I have selected the minimal amount of information and examples to get you going in your own research visualization endeavors in biomedical research. For that reason, this chapter only deals with the base `ggplot()` function and its most important usage scenarios.  
In my opinion, you are best prepared when first learning the ggplot "language" structure, not the complete listing of possibilities. You can check these out later on your own. If you are interested in what the package has to offer, type `help(package="ggplot2")` on the console.

### Keep the goal in mind {-}

You should always remember the purpose with which you create a plot:

1. **_Communicate results in a visual way_**. The _audience_ consists of other professionals: fellow scientists, students, project managers, CEO's. The _scope_ is in reports, publications, presentations etc. Your plots should be immaculately annotated - have a title and/or caption, axis labels with physical quantities (e.g. Temperature) and measurement units (e.g. Celsius), and a legend (if relevant).
2. **_Create a representation of data for visual inspection_**. The _audience_ is yourself. This is especially important in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). You visualize your data in order to discover patterns, trends, outliers and to generate new questions and hypotheses. The biggest challenge is to select the correct, most appropriate visualization that keeps you moving on your research track.  

Besides this, you should of course choose a relevant visualization for your data. For instance, generating a boxplot representing only a few data points is a poor choice, as will a scatterplot for millions of data points almost always be.

To help your imagination and see what is possible you should really browse through [The R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/). It has code for all the charts in the gallery.

## Getting started

Install the packages `ggplot2` and `tidyr` first, if not already installed. The package ggplot2 is the topic of this chapter of course. Package tidyr is the topic of a later chapter, but we'll see a use case of it here already.

```{r install-ggplot2, eval=F}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidyr")
```

After installing, you'll need to load the packages.

```{r load-libs, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```


### A first plot {-}

Let's dive right in and create a first plot, and walk through the different parts of this code.

```{r first-plot, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A scatter plot visualizing Ozone as a function of Temperature"}
ggplot(data = airquality, mapping = aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) + 
  geom_point()
```

There are two **_chained function calls_**: `ggplot()` and `geom_point()`. They are chained using the `+` operator. The first function, `ggplot()`, creates the base layer of the plot It receives the data and defines how it maps to the two axes. By itself, `ggplot()`, will not display anything of your data. It creates an empty plot where the axes are defined and have the correct scale:

```{r empty-plot, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="An empty plot pane"}
ggplot(data = airquality, mapping = aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone))
```

The next function, `geom_point()`, builds on the base layer it receives via the `+` operator and adds a new layer to the plot, a data representation using points.

The `geom_point()` function encounters rows with missing data and issues a warning (`Warning: Removed 37 rows...`) but proceeds anyway. There are two ways to prevent this annoying warning message. The first is to put a `warning=FALSE` statement in the RMarkdown chunk header. This is usually **not** a good idea because you should be explicit about problem handling when implementing a data analysis workflow because it hinders the reproducibility of your work. Therefore, removing the missing values explicitly is a better solution:

```{r plot-warnings-prevented, eval=FALSE}
airquality <- na.omit(airquality)
ggplot(data = airquality, mapping = aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note that this overwrites the build-in dataset `airquality` for the duration of this R session.  

To obtain a similar plot as created above with "base" R, you would have done something like this:

```{r first-plot-baseR, fig.asp=0.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The same visualization with base R'}
with(airquality, plot(x = Temp, y = Ozone))
```

You can immediately see why ggplot2 has become so popular. When creating more complex plots it becomes more obvious still, as shown below.

### Adding a dimension using color {-}

This plot shows the power of ggplot2: building complex visualizations with minimal code.

```{r first-plot-w-color1, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, fig.cap='Ozone as function of Temp with plot symbols colored by Month'}
airquality$Month_f <- as.factor(airquality$Month)
airquality$TempFac <- cut(airquality$Temp, 
                          breaks = c(50, 75, 100), 
                          labels = c("low", "high"), 
                          ordered_result = T)
ggplot(data = airquality, mapping = aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone, color = Month_f)) +
  geom_point() 
```


### Inspecting and tuning the figure  {-}

What can you tell about the data and its measurements when looking at this plot? 

Looking at the above plot, you should notice that  

(a) the temperature measurement is probably in degrees Fahrenheit. This should be apparent from the plot. The measurement unit for Ozone is missing. You should look both up; the `datasets` package doc says it is in Parts Per Billion (ppb).  
(b) temperature is lowest in the fifth month -probably May but once again you should make certain- and highest in months 8 and 9.
(c) ozone levels seem positively correlated with temperature (or Month), but not in an obvious linear way
(d) a detail: temperature is measured in whole degrees only. This will give plotting artifacts: discrete vertical lines of data points.  

The plot below fixes and addresses the above issues to create a publication-ready figure. We'll get to the details of this code as we proceed in this chapter. For now the message is **_be meticulous in constructing your plot_**.

```{r first-plot-w-color2, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, fig.cap='Ozone level dependency on Temperature. Grey area: Loess smoother with 95% confidence interval. Source: R dataset \"Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.\"'}
airquality$Month_f <- factor(airquality$Month, 
                           levels = 1:12, 
                           labels = month.abb)
ggplot(data = airquality, 
       mapping = aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Month_f)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x) + #the default formula, but prevents a printed message
  xlab(expression("Temperature " (degree~F))) +
  ylab("Ozone (ppb)") +
  labs(color = "Month")
```


## ggplot2 and the theory of graphics

### Philosophy of ggplot2 {-}

The author of ggplot2, Hadley Wickham, had a very clear goal in mind when he embarked on the development of this package:

_"The emphasis in ggplot2 is reducing the amount of thinking time by making it easier to go from the plot in your brain to the plot on the page." (Wickham, 2012)_

The way this is achieved is through "**_The grammar of graphics_**"

### The grammar of graphics {-}

The grammar of graphics tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to geometric objects (points, lines, bars) with aesthetic attributes (color, shape, size).

The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinate system. Faceting -grid layout- can be used to generate the same plot for different subsets of the dataset.
(Wickham, 2010)



## Building plots with ggplot2

### The layered plot architecture {-}

A graph in ggplot2 is built using a few "layers", or building blocks. 

```{r ggplot2-building-blocks-1, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
blocks <- read.table("data/ggplot2_elements.txt",
                     sep=";",
                     header = T,
                     as.is = 1:2)
#datatable(blocks[1:3, ], caption = 'The three core ggplot2 layers')
knitr::kable(blocks[1:3,],
            caption = 'The three core ggplot2 layers')
```

First, there is the **_data_** layer - the input data that you want to visualize:

![The data layer](graphics/data_layer_50p.png#center)

Next, using the `aes()` function, the data is **_mapped_** to a coordinate system. This encompasses not only the xy-coordinates but also possible extra plot dimensions such as color and shape.


![The data and aesthetic layers](graphics/data_aes_layers_50p.png#center)

As a third step, the data is **_visually represented_** in some way, using a **_geometry_** (dealt with by one of the many `geom_....()` functions). Examples of geometries are **_point_** for scatterplots, **_boxplot_**, **_line_** etc.

![The data, aesthetic and geometry layers](graphics/data_aes_geom_layers_50p.png#center)

At a minimum, these three layers are used in every plot you create. 

Besides these fundamental aspects there are other elements you may wish to add or modify: axis labels, legend, titles, etc. These constitute additional, optional layers:

![All layers](graphics/all_layers_50p.png#center)

Except for Statistics and Coordinates, each of these layers will be discussed in detail in subsequent paragraphs.

### "Tidy" the data {-}

This is a very important aspect of plotting using ggplot2: getting the data in a way that ggplot2 can deal with it. Sometimes it may be a bit challenging to get the data in such a format: some form of data mangling is often required. This is the topic of a next chapter, but here you'll already see a little preview.

The ggplot2 function expects its data to come in a **_tidy_** format. A dataset is considered **_tidy_** when it is formed according to these rules:

1. Each variable has its own column.
2. Each observation has its own row.
3. Each value has its own cell.

Want to know more about tidy data? Read the paper by Hadley Wickham: [@tidy-data].

Here is an example dataset that requires some mangling, or **_tidying_**, to adhere to these rules.

```{r read-dose-response, echo=FALSE}
dose_response <- read.table("data/dose_response2.txt",
                            header = T,
                            sep=";",
                            colClasses=c("character", "factor", "integer", "integer"))
DT::datatable(dose_response, 
              options = list(pageLength = 15,
                             dom = 'tpli'))
#knitr::kable(head(dose_response))
```

This dataset is not tidy because there is an independent variable -the dose- that should have its own column; its value is now buried inside two column headers (`dose10mg` and `dose10mg`). Also, there is actually a single variable -the response- that is now split into two columns. Thus, a row now contains two observations. 

Suppose you want to plot the response as a function of the dose. That is not quite possible right now in ggplot2. This is because you want to do something like

```{r does-not-work1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=dose_response,
       mapping = aes(x = "<I want to get the dose levels here>",
                     y = "<I want to get the response here>")) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

The problem is you cannot **_specify the mapping in a straightforward manner_**.
Note that in base R you would probably do this:

```{r plot-with-untidy-data, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Selecting untidy data'}
boxplot(dose_response$dose10mg, dose_response$dose100mg)
```

So, we need to tidy this dataframe since the `dose_10_response` and `dose_100_response` columns actually describe the same variable (measurement) but with different _conditions_. As an exercise, I tried it using base R. Here is my solution. 

```{r}
tidy_my_df <- function(df) {
    create_tidy_columns <- function(x) {
        data.frame(patient = rep(x[1], 2),
                   sex = rep(x[2], 2),
                   dose = c(10, 100),
                   response = c(x[3], x[4]))
    }
    
    tmp <- Reduce(function(x, y) merge(x, y, all=TRUE), 
           apply(X = df, MARGIN = 1, FUN = create_tidy_columns))
    tmp[order(tmp$dose), ]
}
DT::datatable(tidy_my_df(dose_response), 
              options = list(pageLength = 15,
                             dom = 'tpli'))
```

Luckily, there is a very nice package that makes this quite easy: `tidyr`.

#### Tidying data using `tidyr::pivot_longer()` {-}

```{r tidy-it1}
## tidy
dose_response_tidy <- pivot_longer(data = dose_response,
                                   cols = c("dose10mg", "dose100mg"),
                                   names_pattern = "dose(\\d+)mg",
                                   names_to = "dose",
                                   values_to = "response")

DT::datatable(dose_response_tidy, 
              options = list(pageLength = 15,
                             dom = 'tpli'))
```

The data is tidy now, and ready for use within ggplot2.

We'll explore the `pivot_longer()` function in detail in a next chapter when discussing the `tidyr` package. 

Now, creating the plot in ggplot2 is a breeze

```{r plot-tidy-basic, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
dr_plot <- ggplot(dose_response_tidy, aes(x = dose, y = response))
dr_plot + 
    geom_boxplot()
```

Would you proceed with this hypothetical drug?

## Aesthetics 

After you obtain a tidy dataset and pass it to ggplot you must decide what the aesthetics are: the way the data are represented in your plot. Very roughly speaking, you could correlate the aesthetics to the **_dimensions_** of the data you want to visualize. For instance, given this chapters' first example of the airquality dataset, the aesthetics were defined in three "dimensions":  
- dimension "X" for temperature, 
- dimension "Y" for Ozone 
- dimension "color" for the month. 

Although color is used most often to represent an extra dimension in the data, other aesthetics you may consider are shape, size, line width, line type and facetting (making a grid of plots).

### Colors {-}

Colors can be defined in a variety of ways in ggpplot (and R in general):

- color name
- existing color palette
- custom color palette

Below is a panel displaying all named colors you can use in R

```{r color-names, fig.asp=3, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
d <- data.frame(c = colors(), 
                y = seq(0, length(colors())-1)%%66, 
                x = seq(0, length(colors())-1)%/%66)
ggplot() +
scale_x_continuous(name="", breaks=NULL, expand=c(0, 0)) +
scale_y_continuous(name="", breaks=NULL, expand=c(0, 0)) +
scale_fill_identity() +
geom_rect(data=d, mapping=aes(xmin=x, xmax=x+1, ymin=y, ymax=y+1), fill="white") +
geom_rect(data=d, mapping=aes(xmin=x+0.05, xmax=x+0.95, ymin=y+0.5, ymax=y+1, fill=c)) +
geom_text(data=d, mapping=aes(x=x+0.5, y=y+0.5, label=c, size = 5), 
          colour="black", hjust=0.5, vjust=1, size=3)
```


When you provide a literal (character) for the color aesthetic it will simply be that color. If you want to map a property (e.g. "Month") to a range of colors, you should use a color palette. Since ggplot has build-in color palettes, you can simply use `color=<my-third-dimension-variable>`. This variable mapping to color can be either a factor (discrete scale) or numeric (continuous scale). 
The ggplot function will map the variable the default color palette.

Be aware that there is a big difference in where you specify an aesthetic. When it should be mapped onto a variable (the values within a column) you should put it within the `aes()` call. When you want to specify a literal -static- aesthetic (e.g. color) you place it outside the `aes()` call. When you misplace the mapping you get strange behavior:

```{r color-scope-1, fig.asp=.75, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
    geom_point(aes(color = 'Green'))
```

This will not work either (not evaluated because it gives an error):

```{r color-scope-2, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
    geom_point(color = Species)
```

And when you specify it twice the most 'specific' will take precedence (but the legend label is incorrect here):

```{r color-scope-3, fig.asp=.75, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = na.omit(airquality), 
       mapping = aes(x = Ozone, y = Solar.R, color = Month_f)) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Day))
```

Have a look at the paragraph "Inheritance of aesthetics" for more detail.
Here are some ways to work with color palettes

#### The default palette {-}

```{r color-palette-default, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
#store it in variable "sp" for re-use in subsequenct chunks
sp <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
    geom_point(aes(color = Species))
sp
```


#### Manual palettes {-}

You can specify your own colors using `scale_color_manual()` for scatter plots or `scale_fill_manual()` for boxplots and bar plots.

```{r color-palette-manual, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
sp + scale_color_manual(values = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"))
```

Here the palette is defined using the **_hexadecimal_** notation: Each color can be specified as a mix of Red, Green, and Blue values in a range from 0 to 255. In Hexadecimal notation these are the position 1 and 2 (Red), 3 and 4 (Green) and 5 and 6 (Blue) after the hash sign (#). `00` equals zero and `FF` equals 255 (16*16). This is quite a universal encoding: a gazillion websites style their pages using this notation.

Here is a nice set of colors:

```{r custom-palette1, fig.asp=0.3, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
custom_col <- c("#FFDB6D", "#C4961A", "#F4EDCA", 
                "#D16103", "#C3D7A4", "#52854C", "#4E84C4", "#293352")
show_palette(custom_col, cols=length(custom_col))
```

Here is a colorblind-friendly palette:

```{r custom-palette2, fig.asp=0.3, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
# The palette with grey:
cbp1 <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",
          "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

show_palette(cbp1, cols=length(cbp1))
```

When you pass a palette that is longer than the number of levels in your factor, R will only use as many as required:

```{r color-palette-manual2, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
sp + scale_color_manual(values = cbp1)
```

#### RColorBrewer palettes {-}

R provides the "RColorBrewer" package. The `brewer.pal` function has several palettes for various applications at your disposal. Have a look at `brewer.pal.info`, which lists all:

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
knitr::kable(brewer.pal.info)
```

For instance, here is `Pastel2`:

```{r rcolorbrewer-pastel, fig.asp=0.3, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
show_palette(brewer.pal(8, "Pastel2"), cols = 8)
```

Here, an RColorBrewer palette is used with the Iris data. 

```{r rcolorbrewer-palette, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Species)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=brewer.pal(6, "Dark2")) #only 3 required
```



### Shapes {-}

These are the shapes available in ggplot2 (and base R as well).

```{r shapes-overview,, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
shapes <- data.frame(
  shape = c(0:19, 22, 21, 24, 23, 20),
  x = 0:24 %/% 5,
  y = -(0:24 %% 5)
)
ggplot(shapes, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label = shape), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.15) +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  #expand_limits(x = 4.1) +
  theme_void()
```


Warning: do not clutter your plot with too many dimensions/aesthetics!

### Lines {-}

Geoms that draw lines have a "linetype" parameter.

Legal values are the strings "blank", "solid", "dashed", "dotted", "dotdash", "longdash", and "twodash". Alternatively, the numbers 0 to 6 can be used (0 for "blank", 1 for "solid", ...).

You can set line type to a constant value. For this you use the linetype geom parameter. For instance, `geom_line(data=d, mapping=aes(x=x, y=y), linetype=3)` sets the line type of all lines in that layer to 3, which corresponds to a dotted line), but you can also use it dynamically.

Here is an example where the female and male deaths in the UK for 72 successive months are plotted. The `linetype = sex` aesthetic could as well have been defined within the global `ggplot` call. It may be a bit more logical to specify it where it applies to the geom.

```{r linecolor-dim, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
deaths <- data.frame(
    month = rep(1:72, times = 2), 
    sex = rep(factor(c("m", "f")), each = 72),
    deaths = c(mdeaths, fdeaths)
)

ggplot(data = deaths, mapping = aes(x = month, y = deaths)) +
    geom_line(aes(linetype = sex))
```


### Size {-}

The size of the plotting symbol can also be used as an extra dimension in your visualization. Here is an example showing the solar radiation of the airquality data as third dimension.

```{r sizes-demo, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = na.omit(airquality), 
       mapping = aes(x = Wind, y = Ozone, size = Solar.R)) +
    geom_point(color = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(size = "Solar radiation (Lang)") 
```


## Geometries

### What are geometries {-}

Geometries are the ways data can be visually represented. Boxplot, scatterplot and histogram are a few examples. There are **_many_** geoms available in ggplot2; type `geom_` in the console and you will get a listing. Even more are available outside the ggplot2 package. Here we'll only explore the most used geoms in science. 

### Boxplot {-}

Boxplot is one of the most-used data visualizations. It displays the 5-number summary containing from bottom to top: minimum, first quartile, median (= second quartile), third quartile, maximum. Outliers, usually defined as more than `1.5 * IQR` from the median, are displayed as separate points. Some color was added in the example below.

```{r plot_geom_boxplot, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
dr_plot <- ggplot(dose_response_tidy, aes(x = dose, y = response))
dr_plot + geom_boxplot(fill='#E69F00')
```

### Jitter {-}

Jitter is a good alternative to boxplot when you have small sample sizes, or discrete measurements with many exact copies, resulting in much overlap. Use the width and height attributes to adjust the jittering.

```{r plot_geom_jitter, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
dr_plot + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0)
```

Note that vertical jitter was set to zero because the y-axis values are already in a continuous scale. You should use vertical jittering only when these have discreet values that otherwise overlap too much.  

Below, a split over the sexes is added. Suddenly, a dramatic dosage effect becomes apparent that was smoothed out when the two sexes were combined. 

```{r plot_tidy_color, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
dr_plot + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0, aes(colour = sex))
```

Alternatively, use a grid of plots to emphasize the contrast further.
 
```{r plot_tidy_facet, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
dr_plot + 
    geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0, aes(colour = sex)) + 
    facet_wrap( . ~ sex)
```

### Plot overlays: boxplot + jitter {-}

This example shows how you can overlay plots on top of each other as much as you like. The order in which you define the layers is the order in which they are stacked on top of each other in the graph. You could use this as a feature:

```{r plot-overlays, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
library(gridExtra) 
dr_plot <- ggplot(dose_response_tidy, aes(x = dose, y = response))
p1 <- dr_plot + 
    geom_boxplot(fill='#E69F00') +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0, size = 2, alpha = 0.4)
p2 <- dr_plot + 
    geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0, size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='#E69F00') 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1) #create a panel of plots
```
The `gridExtra` package is discussed in a more complex setting below, in section "Advanced plotting aspects".

### Plot overlays: smooth + ribbon {-}

Here is another pair of examples of overlays of different geoms. In the first, the original datapoints are included. 


```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "darkgreen", method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x") +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0,
                    ymax = predict(loess(hwy ~ displ))),
                alpha = 0.3, fill = 'green')
```

Note that the `method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x"` arguments to `geom_smooth()` are the defaults. However, if omitted they trigger a message (`\`geom_smooth()\` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'`) that I do not like in my output.
In this second example, the data points are omitted altogether, making the plot focus solely on global trend.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "darkgreen") +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 10,
                    ymax = predict(loess(hwy ~ displ))),
                alpha = 0.3, fill = 'green') +
    ylim(10, max(mpg$hwy))
```


### Scatterplot: Points {-}

The `geom_point()` function is used to create the good old scatterplot of which we have seen several examples already.


### Line plots {-}

When points can be logically connected it may be a good idea to use a line to visualize trends, as we have seen in the `deaths` plot in section Aesthetics.

If you want both lines and points you need to overlay them. In this example I take it a bit further bu adding the dimension 'activity' to the points geom only. This is a typical case for geom_line since the measurements of the two beavers were taken sequentially, for that particular beaver.

```{r overlay-points-lines-beavers, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
b1_start <- beaver1[1, "time"] / 60
b2_start <- beaver1[2, "time"] / 60

suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
#uses dplyr (later this course)
beaverA <- beaver1 %>% mutate(time_h = seq(from = b1_start, 
                                           to = b1_start + (nrow(beaver1)*10)/60, 
                                           length.out = nrow(beaver1)))
beaverB <- beaver2 %>% mutate(time_h = seq(from = b2_start, 
                                           to = b2_start + (nrow(beaver2)*10)/60, 
                                           length.out = nrow(beaver2)))
beavers_all <- bind_rows(beaverA, beaverB) %>%
    mutate(beaver = c(rep("1", nrow(beaverA)), rep("2", nrow(beaverB))),
           activity = factor(activ, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("inactive", "active")))

ggplot(data = beavers_all, aes(x = time_h, y = temp)) +
    geom_line(aes(linetype = beaver)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = activity)) +
    xlab("time (h)") +
    ylab(expression('Temperature ('*~degree*C*')'))
```




### Histograms {-}

A histogram is a means to visualize the distribution of a dataset, as are boxplot (`geom_boxplot()`), violin plot (`geom_violin()`) and density plot (`geom_freqpoly()`).

Here we look at the eruption intervals of the "faithful" geyser. A `binwidth` argument is used to adjust the number of bins. Alternative use the `bins` argument.

```{r histogram1, fig.asp=.75, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data=faithful, mapping = aes(x = waiting)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)
```

There are some statistics available to adjust what is shown on the y axis. The default that is used by `geom_histogram` is `stat(count)`, so if you don't specify anything this will be used. But if you want it scaled to a maximum of 1, use `stat(count / max(count))`. The `stat()` function is a flag to ggplot2 that you want to use calculated aesthetics produced by the statistic.You can use any transformation of the statistic, e.g. `y = stat(log2(count))`.

```{r histogram2, fig.asp=.75, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data=faithful, mapping = aes(x = waiting)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, aes(y = stat(count / max(count)))) + 
    ylab(label = "normalized proportion")
    ```

Alternatively, if you want percentages, you can use `y = stat(count / sum(count) * 100)`.

```{r histogram3, fig.asp=.75, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data=faithful, mapping = aes(x = waiting)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, mapping = aes(y = stat(count / sum(count) * 100))) + 
    ylab(label = "%")
```

### Violin plot {-}

A violin plot is a compact display of a continuous distribution. It is a blend of geom_boxplot() and geom_density(): a violin plot is a mirrored density plot displayed in the same way as a boxplot. It is not seen as often as should be. An example best explains.

```{r violinplot, fig.asp=.75, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data=airquality, mapping = aes(x = Month_f, y = Temp, fill = Month_f)) +
    geom_violin() + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Barplot {-}

The bar plot is similar to a histogram in appearance, but quite different in intent. Where a histogram visualizes the density of a continuous variable, a bar plot tries to visualize the counts or weights of distinct groups.

Here is a small example where the ten subjects of the `sleep` dataset have been charted (the x axis), and the `extra` column provided the height of the bar, split over the two groups. When no weight is provided, the occurrences of the different group levels will be counted and sued as weight.

```{r barplot1, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = sleep, mapping = aes(ID)) +
    geom_bar(aes(weight = extra, fill = group))
```


### Overview of the main geoms {-}

There are many geoms and even more outside the ggplot2 package.
Here is a small overview of some of them.

```{r ggplot2-building-blocks-2, echo=FALSE}
geoms <- read.table("data/geom_functions.txt",
                     sep = ";",
                     header = T,
                     as.is = 1:2)
knitr::kable(geoms, caption = 'Some more geoms')
```

If you want to know them all, simply type `?geom_` and select the one that looks like the thing you want, or go to the tidyverse [ggplot2 reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/).

## Inheritance of aesthetics

Like the main `ggplot()` function, every `geom_` function accepts its own `mapping = aes(...)`. The mapping is _inherited_ from the ggplot() function so any `aes(...)` mapping defined in the main `ggplot()` call applies to all subsequent layers. However, you can specify your own "local" aesthetic mapping within a `geom_xxxx()`. Aesthetics defined within a geom_ function are scoped to that function call only. 

In the plot below you see how this works (it is not a nice plot anymore, I know).
Note that any aesthetic value specified outside the aes() function is simply a static property (in that scope).

```{r inheritace, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', warning=F}
ggplot(data = na.omit(airquality), mapping = aes(x = Solar.R, y = Ozone)) +
    geom_smooth(aes(linetype = Month_f), method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
    geom_point(aes(color = Month_f), alpha = 0.7) 
```

Also note that you can "override" global (`ggplot()`) aesthetics in `geom_xxx()` but this can give unexpected behavior, as seen in the paragraph on Color.

## Faceting

Faceting is the process of splitting into multiple plots with exactly the same coordinate system where each plot show a subset of the data. It can be applied to any geom. The figure above could be improved slightly with this technique. 

```{r facetting, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', warning=F}
ggplot(data = airquality, mapping = aes(x = Solar.R, y = Ozone)) +
    geom_smooth(aes(linetype = Month_f), method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
    geom_point(aes(color = Month_f), alpha = 0.7) + 
    facet_wrap(. ~ Month_f)
```


## Experimenting with geoms and aesthetics

The process in plotting using ggplot2 is usually very iterative.  
You start with the base plot, passing it the **_aesthetic_** for x and y, as shown above, and then experiment with **_geometries_**,  **_colors_** and **_faceting_**.

Look at every result and ask yourself **_what story does is tell?_** and **_is this the story I want to tell?_**.

Only after you finish this phase you should apply make-up (labels, texts).
Maybe new questions have arisen as a result of the plot you created?

## Multivariate Categorical Data

Visualizing multivariate categorical data requires another approach. Scatter- and line plots and histograms are all unsuitable for factor data. Here are some plotting examples that work well for categorical data. Copied and adapted from [STHDA site](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/32-r-graphics-essentials/129-visualizing-multivariate-categorical-data/).

The first example deals with the builtin dataset `HairEyeColor`. It is a contingency table and a `table` object so it must be converted into a dataframe before use.

```{r}
hair_eye_col_df <- as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)
head(hair_eye_col_df)
```
### Bar plots of contingency tables

```{r faceted-barplot, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(hair_eye_col_df, aes(x = Hair, y = Freq)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = Eye), 
           stat = "identity", 
           color = "white",
           position = position_dodge(0.7)) + #causes overlapping bars
    facet_wrap(~ Sex) 
```

### Balloon plot

Here is a dataset called `housetasks` that contains data on who does what tasks within the household. 

```{r}
(housetasks <- read.delim(
  system.file("demo-data/housetasks.txt", package = "ggpubr"),
  row.names = 1))
```
A balloon plot is an excellent way to visualize this kind of data. The function `ggballoonplot()` is part of the ggpubr package ("'ggplot2' Based Publication Ready Plots"). Have a look at [this page](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/) for a nice review of its possibilities. 

```{r balloonplot1, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggpubr::ggballoonplot(housetasks, fill = "value")
```
As you can see the counts map to both size and color.
Balloon plots can also be faceted.

```{r balloonplot2, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggpubr::ggballoonplot(hair_eye_col_df, x = "Hair", y = "Eye", size = "Freq",
              fill = "Freq", facet.by = "Sex",
              ggtheme = theme_bw()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C")
```

### Mosaic plot

A mosaic plot (library vcd) scales the tiles according to the count.

```{r mosaic, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
suppressMessages(library(vcd))
mosaic(HairEyeColor, #needs an object of type table
       shade = TRUE, 
       legend = TRUE) 
```

### Correspondence analysis

This type needs at least 3 columns, otherwise you get hard-to solve errors!
Row names should not be in the first column, but assigned as `row.names`.

```{r correspondence-analysis, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
suppressMessages({library(FactoMineR)
                  library(factoextra)})
res.ca <- CA(housetasks, graph = FALSE) # package FactoMineR performs correspondence analysis
fviz_ca_biplot(res.ca, repel = TRUE) # package factoextra visualizes
```


## Advanced plotting aspects

### Plot panels from `for` loops using `gridExtra::grid.arrange()`

Sometimes you may wish to create a panel of plots using a `for` loop, similarly to the use of `par(mfrow = c(rows, cols))` in base R. There are a few caveats to this seemingly simple notion.

For instance, to create a set of boxplots for a few columns of the `airquality` dataset, you would do something like this in base R: 

```{r panel-plots-base-R, results='hold'}
# set the number of rows and columns
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

# iterate the column names
for (n in names(airquality[, 1:4])) {
    boxplot(airquality[, n], 
            xlab = n)
}

# reset par
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

When you naively migrate this structure to a ggplot setting, it will become something like this.

```{r panel-plots-ggplot-1, out.width="30%", results='hold'}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

for (n in names(airquality[, 1:4])) {
    plt <- ggplot(data = airquality,
                  mapping = aes(y = n)) +
        geom_boxplot() +
        xlab(n)
    print(plt)
}

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

This is surely not the plot you would have expected: a single straight line, and no panel of plots. It turns out you can not use variables as selectors in `aes()`. You need to use `aes_string()` for that purpose. 
Also note that if you omit the `print(plt)` call this outputs _nothing_, which is really quite confusing. You need to explicitely print the plot, not implicitly as you normally can.  
Here is a second version.


```{r panel-plots-ggplot-2, out.width="30%", results='hold'}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

for (n in names(airquality[, 1:4])) {
    plt <- ggplot(data = na.omit(airquality),
                  mapping = aes_string(y = n)) +
        geom_boxplot() +
        xlab(n)
    print(plt)
}

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

This works as required except for the panel-of-plots part. The `mfrow` option to `par()` does not work with `ggplot2`. This can be fixed through the use of the `gridExtra` package, together with the base R `do.call()` function.  

```{r panel-plots-ggplot-3, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
library(gridExtra)
airquality_no_na <- na.omit(airquality)
# a list to store the plots
my_plots <- list()

#use of indices instead of names is important!
for (i in 1:4) {
    n <- names(airquality)[i]
    #omitting rows with NA for each single column
    plt <- ggplot(data = airquality_no_na,
                  mapping = aes_string(y = n)) +
        geom_boxplot() +
        xlab(n)
    my_plots[[i]] <- plt   # has to be integer, not name!
}
#use do.call() to process the list in grid.arrange
do.call(grid.arrange, c(my_plots, nrow = 2))
```

So the rules for usage of a for-loop to create a panel of plots:

- use `aes_string()` to specify your columns
- store the plots in a list
- use `grid.arrange()` to create the panel, wrapped in the `do.call()` function.


### The `GGally::ggPairs()` function

The `ggpairs()` function of the `GGally` package allows you to build a scatterplot matrix just like the base R `pairs()` function.

Scatterplots of each pair of numeric variable are drawn on the left part of the figure. Pearson correlation is displayed on the right. Variable distribution is available on the diagonal.

```{r ggpairs-demo, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
GGally::ggpairs(airquality_no_na[1:4], progress = FALSE)
```

Look at [https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/199-correlation-matrix-with-ggally.html](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/199-correlation-matrix-with-ggally.html) for more examples.

### Marginal plots using `ggExtra::ggMarginal()`

You can use `ggMarginal()` to add marginal distributions to the X and Y axis of a ggplot2 scatterplot. 
It can be done using histogram, boxplot or density plot using the `ggExtra` package

```{r ggmarginal-demo, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
library(ggExtra)

# base plot
p <- ggplot(airquality, aes(x=Temp, y=Ozone, color=Month_f)) +
      geom_point() +
      theme(legend.position="none")

p1 <- ggMarginal(p, type="histogram")
p2 <- ggMarginal(p, type="density")
p3 <- ggMarginal(p, type="boxplot")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)
```


See [https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/277-marginal-histogram-for-ggplot2.html](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/277-marginal-histogram-for-ggplot2.html) for more details.



## Final tweaks

This section describes aspects that fall outside the standard realm of plot construction.

### Scales, Coordinates and Annotations {-}

Scales and Coordinates are used to adjust the way your data is mapped and displayed. Here, a log10 scale is applied to the y axis using `scale_y_log10()` and the x axis is reversed (from high to low values instead of low to high) using `scale_x_reverse()`.

```{r tweeking, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = cars, mapping = aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_log10() + 
    scale_x_reverse() 
```

In other contexts, such as geographic information analysis, the scale is extremely important.
The default coordinate system in ggplot2 is `coord_cartesian()`. In the plot below, a different coordinate system is used. 

```{r polarplot, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
# function to compute standard error of mean
se <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x)) 

DF <- data.frame(variable = as.factor(1:10), value = log2(2:11))

ggplot(DF, aes(variable, value, fill = variable)) +
    geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", color = "white") +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = value - se(value), 
                      ymax = value + se(value), 
                      color = variable), 
                      width = .2) + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:nlevels(DF$variable)) +
    coord_polar() 
```

### Labels {-}

You have seen the `xlab()`, `ylab()`, and `labs()` functions at work already.

### Themes {-}

The theme is used to make changes to the overall appearance of the plot. Two approaches exist. The simplest one is selecting a specific theme and make some minor adjustments at most.
Here are is the minimal theme where the text sizes have been modified somewhat.

```{r themes1, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = airquality, mapping=aes(x=Temp, y=Ozone)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Month_f)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x) +
  xlab(expression("Temperature " (degree~F))) +
  ylab("Ozone (ppb)") +
  labs(color = "Month") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

Note that if the `color = Month_f` aesthetic would have been put in the main ggplot call, the smoother would have been split over the Month groups.

Alternatively, the theme can be specified completely, as show below.

```{r themes2, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = na.omit(airquality), mapping = aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Month_f)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  xlab("Temperature (F)") +
  ylab("Ozone (ppb)") +
  labs(color = "Month") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, colour = "blue", face = "bold"),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, colour = "red", face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16, colour = "blue", face = "bold.italic"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, colour = "red", face = "bold.italic"),
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "darkblue", size = 1, linetype = "solid"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

As you can see, there are `element_text()`, `element_line()` and `element_rect()` functions to specify these types of plot elements. The `element_blank()` function can be used in various theme aspects to prevent it from being displayed.

#### Adjust or set global theme

You can specify within your document or R session that a certain theme should be used throughout. You can do this by using the `theme_set()`, `theme_update()` and `theme_replace()` functions, or with the esoteric `%+replace%` operator. Type `?theme_set` to find out more.

### Annotation {-}

A final layer that can be added one containing **_annotations_**. Annotations are elements that are added manually to the plot. This can be a text label, a fictitious data point, a shaded box or an arrow indicating a region of interest.  

In the `annotate()` method, you specify the geom you wish to add (e.g. "text", "point")
The panel below demonstrates a few.


```{r annotation, fig.asp=.75, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
(outlier <- airquality[!is.na(airquality$Ozone) & airquality$Ozone > 150, ])

ggplot(data = na.omit(airquality), mapping = aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 72, xmax = 77, ymin = 0, ymax = 50, 
           alpha = 0.1, color = "blue", fill = "blue") +
  annotate("point", x = outlier$Temp, y = outlier$Ozone, 
           color = "darkred", size = 4, alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Month_f)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x) +
  xlab("Temperature (F)") +
  ylab("Ozone (ppb)") + 
  annotate("text", x = outlier$Temp, y = outlier$Ozone -5, label = "Outlier") + 
  annotate("segment", x = outlier$Temp + 5, xend = outlier$Temp + 1, 
           y = outlier$Ozone + 4, yend = outlier$Ozone, 
           color = "darkred", size = 2, arrow = arrow()) 
```

Note there is a `geom_rectangle()` as well, but as I have discovered after much sorrow, it behaves quite unexpectedly when using the `alpha = ` argument on its fill color. For annotation puyrposes you should always use the `annotate()` function.
