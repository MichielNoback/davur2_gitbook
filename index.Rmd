# Preface {-}

This is the ebook accompanying the course Data Analysis and Visualization using R 2 (DAVuR2). The book will be available during the final test. These packages and subjects will be covered:

- ggplot2
- tidyr
- dplyr
- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- working with Timeseries and Dates and times
- programming R: functions, scripts, packages and dockumentation

Note that this entire ebook was written in Markdown, using a RMarkdown extension called bookdown [@bookdown]. This is (sort of) a "gitbook" layer on top of the RMarkdown processing package knitr [@knitr].


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
